                Cycle 6 is our final project for Digital Fabrication. The final had to contain multiple processes I have learned throughgout the semester. The processes had to be sufficiently integrated into whatever I chose to design. 
                <br><br>
                 I chose to design something reletively simple, but complicated for my abilities. I decided to create an image from acrylic using the laser cutter, and then add a LED companent. I later added a couple more components using the 3-D printers and electronic compannents in the lab. 
                 <br><br>
                 The first step to constructing the project was to laser cut the image I designed onto the acrylic. I edited the chose image in adobe illistrator making sure the image was traced and expanded so the machine would recognize the cuts. The I added some texts to the top of the image to personalise the image. Finally I exported the image as an SVG file an uploaded it to google drive to print the image on the acyrlic in the lab.

                After laser cutting the acylic I had two more processes to complete. The next process I started was 3-D printing a stand for the image. 
                <br><br>
                 I designed the stand on fusion 360 and was hoping to create something simple and sleek. The stand didn't take long to design nor print. I only had to create a simple shape and make a couple of extrusions all while measuring the width of the acrylic to make sure the image would stay secure and the LEDS would have a place to rest.  
                 <br><br>
                 After deisgning the stand I used Arduino to activate the LED lights. I downloaded a NEOpixel code from the Arduino library and to run a simple green light that turned on each LED one at a time. This was my finished product for the project until I decided to go a step further and learn to create a board to run the LED's on their own.

                Through the help of some friends I was able to use KiCad to design and mill a circuit board. I also soldered the chip and electronic pieces together. This process was challenging and took a long time to get right. AFter the the circuit board was complete and tested I placed the board into the 3-D printed case.
