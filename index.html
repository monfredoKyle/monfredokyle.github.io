                Hello! My name is Kyle Joseph Monfredo. My graduation year is 2023 and my major is Business and Management. I am a member of the Wheaton College Track and Field Team. I also participate with some other clubsand extracurricular activies. I am taking Digital Fabrication to gather a better understanding of the amentities available to students on camous. I wanted to learn more about 3D printing, laser cutting, and the art of making. During my freshman year I took a course called industrial design where I learned about most of these tools, however do to Covid the class switched remote and any hopes of using the machinery was lossed. This semester I hope to learn what I missed during the pandemic. 
                <br><br>
                On a side note, I am minoring in visual art. I have taken many art classes at Wheaton which have given me new perspectives towards school, sports, and everyday life. I hope to continue my art practices after college through any organization bringing those different perspectives I've learned into the traditional workplace.

                The picture to the left is a sculpture created during my junior year. Through my career at Wheaton I have taken Industrial Design, Scultpure I, 2-D Design, and I hope to take many more to achieve a minor in art which I believe to be very beneficial for my future. Sculpture has been one of my favorite classes so far. 
                <br><br>
                I have titled this sculpture, Wheaton's forgotten sohl. I was inspired from various works of art relating to found objects. I enjoy giving new meaning to objects seemed to be forgotten. Many pieces in the sculture were found in the Wheaton woods. Using a mig welder and parts from old abandoned car I gave a new meaning to and old relic that is now apart of Wheaton. 
                <br><br>
                Through my time at Wheaton I have gained a real understanding of the term liberal arts. My education has been well rounded from the start of my college career. No stone has been left unturned!
