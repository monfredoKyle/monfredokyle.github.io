                Hello! My name is Kyle Joseph Monfredo. My graduation year is 2023 and my major is Business and Management. I am a meber of the Wheaton College Track and Field Team along with some other clubs. I am taking this class to gather a better udnerstanding of the amentities available to students on camous including the Fab Lab, and I wanted to learn more about 3D printing, laser cutting, and making in general. My freshman year I took a course called industrial design where I was going to learn about most of these tools, however do to Covid the class switched remote and the making portion of the class was missed. This semester I hope to learn what I was hoping too three years ago. Lol!

                Not only am a I a Business Major I have questioned the idea of minoring in visual art. I have taken many art classes at WHeaton College which have given me new perspectives towards school, sports, and everyday life.

                One of my later sculptures. Through my career at Wheaton College I have taken Industrial Design, Scultpure I, 2-D Design, and I hope to take many more for the minor. Sculpture has been my favorite class so far, and my final project can be seen to the right.

                Wheaton's forgotten sohl. That's the new name of this piece, because I forgot the origional name! This piece was inspired from the Wheaton woods, and nothing but a boy and a mig welder. Parts from old abandoned cars were dismantled and assembled with a new meaning to create this ild relic that is now apart of Wheaton.

                Through my time at Wheaton I have gained a real understanding of the term liberal arts. My education has been well rounded from the start of my college career. No stone has been left unturned!
